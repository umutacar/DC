# IMPORTANT: 
1) the module pervasives/ must match that inside the diderot
2) the module mlx should containt syntax.py and this should be identical to that from diderot.

This is how MeTaL and Diderot communicate.
  

# Translation to MLX

  In the past, it used to be that strictification and elaboration was done at the DEX level.  We now do these at the MLX level because XML tools make these operations relatively straightforward to implement.  Theferefore dex2mlx does a relatively straightforward translation of DEX to MLX.
  

# Create a standalone executable
pip install pyinstaller
pyinstaller --onefile --windowed file.py


# Note

  I (Umut) was able to port MeTaL to python3 without much difficulty.
  The code for ported dex/ directory is in dex3
  See README3.

  I think we are not going to switch to python3 at the moment.  So I
  am not going to maintain this codebase.
