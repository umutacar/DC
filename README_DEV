# IMPORTANT: 
1) the module pervasives/ must match that inside the diderot
2) the module mlx should containt syntax.py and this should be identical to that from diderot.

This is how MeTaL and Diderot communicate.
  


# Create a standalone executable
pip install pyinstaller
pyinstaller --onefile --windowed file.py


# Note

  I (Umut) was able to port MeTaL to python3 without much difficulty.
  The code for ported dex/ directory is in dex3
  See README3.

  I think we are not going to switch to python3 at the moment.  So I
  am not going to maintain this codebase.
