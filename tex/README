This package is unfinished.  The goal was to translatex DeX to LaTeX
in a way that would allow us to generate pdf using pdflatex instead of
pandoc.  This turns out to be a bit tricker than expected because
there are some differences in DeX and LaTeX due to pandoc/mathjax
limitations.

For example, in DeX we place alignat within math, e.g., 
\[
\begin{alignat}{1}

\end{alignat}
\]

LaTeX convention seems to be that we don't put \[ \] use alignat in
Text mode. 

These could probably be handled but I am unsure that it is worth doing this.
