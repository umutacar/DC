o I have been looking at ODT (Open Document Format) and DocBook.  ODT
is huge and complex, at least for my resources right now.  I am
wondering if Docbook can be a reasonable starting point instead.  The
advantage of docbook is that there are tool out there that convert
latex to docbook, e.g., pandoc.  And thus we can rely on them instead
of trying to parse latex ourselves.  This way our focus would be to
upload docbook into Diderot.  We can implement the docbook to Diderot
XML by writing a relatively straightforward translation I imagine.  

The counter argument is that there are not that many users of docbook.
It might be better for us to focus our efforts on latex support.  But
what exactly is that support?  The idea would be to take plain latex
and convert it into DEX. THINK ABOUT THESE.

o Make this a standalone codebase that works independent of DIL.  THis
is currently just a copy of the DEX part of the diderot project.
