** undefined notation	page 209 bottom	X(n) is not defined; t is not defined.																							

** unclear motivation page 210 top half why/how are you picking
   priorities uniformly among reals in [0,1]? you cannot even ensure
   unicity because you cannot compare reals for equality.

** peculiar choice data structure 12.11 it's weird to define empty to
   be Leaf, which suggests a non-empty tree.  why not Empty?

** clarification page 232, end of second para parenthesize m/n, or
   else write it as a "vertical fraction" to make clear it is the
   argument to the log
																									
** vague comment page 234 "change the algorithm slightly".  either say
   how, or omit this para, it serves no purpose

** presentational inconsistency? definition 12.15 priorities here are
   in Z, whereas for QS they are in [0,1] subset R.  the word
   "priority" suggests that they should be in N, ie always
   non-negative.


** "parametric implementation" data structure 12.11 really, you should
   define BST_CORE and BST_UTIL, where the latter has a structure of
   the former as a component.  the "core" consists of singleton, join,
   and split; the "utilities" have everything else, relative to an
   implementation of these.  that's what it means to be parametric!

** misleading discussion? pages 226-227 the discussion of splay trees,
etc ignores the important issue of single-threaded vs multi-threaded
data structures; amortization doesn't work for the multithreaded case.
do the treaps work for that case?


** hard to follow calculation page 232 displayed equation i find that i
get 1/2 ( 2 / 1 ) = 1 directly by plugging in i=lg(n)-1 into the given
ratio and doing subtraction and addition in the numerator and
denominator.  am i mistaken, or can the calculation be simplified?

** typo	page 233	"Brick" needn't be capitalized																							
** annoying turns of phrase everywhere "it turns out", "it is easy to
   see", other conference-speak

** conflicting notions of priority treaps, quicksort you use reals for
quicksort, integers for treaps, yet analyze treaps via quicksort
undefined terminology page 235 "(pseudo-)random" i don't think you've
every discussed "pseudo-random".  why make this remark?  vague
discussion page 235 the paragraph "The second idea ..." is very vague
and hard to follow.


** vague wording page 235-6 the discussion of split is confusing and
   ungrammatical "because Node on Lines 14 and 18"
