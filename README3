# This is for python3

# Virtual environment set up has changed in python3
  Info: https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html

  Set up
  $ python3 -m venv venv3


# If you are using python3 and python2 on the same computer you have
  to be careful about paths.

  I added the following to venv3/bin/activate

  This will have to be customized for your setup.  The basic idea is
  to make sure that python2 and python3 each get their own libraries,
  because they are not always compatible.


  This goes inside deactivate ()

    # Umut
    # BEGIN: reset pythonpath
    if [ -n "${_OLD_PYTHONPATH:-}" ] ; then
        PYTHONPATH="${_OLD_PYTHONPATH:-}"
        export PYTHONPATH
        unset _OLD_PYTHONPATH
    fi
    # END: reset pythonpath



And this goes an the end 
# Umut
# BEGIN: Set our python to python3
PYTHON3_MODULES=/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.7/lib/python3.7/

_OLD_PYTHONPATH="${PYTHONPATH:-}"
PYTHONPATH="$PYTHON3_MODULES:${PYTHONPATH:-}"
export _OLD_PYTHONPATH
export PYTHONPATH

# END: Set our python to python3


# Another important point, might be best to run pip as follows 

  $ python -m pip

  this makes sure that you are running the right pip. 

# Status:
  Translation to 3 in progress.
  One common need is to hand translate 
  from . import xyz 
  to 
  import xyz

  Translated  to python 3
  ./pervasives/* 
  ./dex3/syntax.py, blocks.py,  parser.py, parse.py
