\section{Problems}


\begin{probl}{Insert}
Design an algorithm for inserting a given key into a BST.
\end{probl}

\begin{probl}{Delete}
Design an algorithm for deleting a given key from a tree. 
\end{probl}



\begin{probl}{Minimum height}
Prove that the minimum possible height of a binary search tree
with $n$ keys is $\lceil \log_2 (n + 1)\rceil$.
\end{probl}

\begin{probl}{Finding Ranges}
Given a BST $T$ and two keys $k_1 \le k_2$ return a BST $T'$ that
contains all the keys in $T$ that fall in the range $[k_1, k_2]$. 
\end{probl}

\begin{probl}{Tree rotations}
In a BST $T$ where the root $v$ has two children, let $u$ and $w$ be
the left and right child of $v$ respectively.  You are asked to
reorganize $T$.  For each reorganization design a constant work and
span algorithm.

\begin{itemize}
\item 
\textbf{Left rotation.} Make $w$ the root of the tree.

\item 
\textbf{Right rotation.} Make $u$ the root of the tree.

\end{itemize}

\end{probl}


\begin{probl}{Size as reduced value}
Show that size information can be computed as a reduced value.  What
is the function to reduce over?
\end{probl}

\begin{probl}{Implementing \ttt{splitRank}}
Implement the \cname{splitRank} function.
\end{probl}

\begin{probl}{Implementing \ttt{select}}
Implement the \cname{select} function using \cname{splitRank}.
\end{probl}
