TODO

* Reorganize the notes to distinguish between algorithm ideas and
  algorithms. Algorithm would be spec'ed in SPARC.  Algorithm ideas
  would be stated in English.

 
* BASED ON CONVERSATIONS WITH DANNY
o We might have gone too far in formalizing the pseudocode. It is good
but then it becomes difficult to read (set notation for example) and
creates a barrier in reasoning about the complexity.  We should
probably eliminate some of these.

o We should introduce a standard pseudo code description for the
algorithms.

o The  WHILE syntax is clumsy, just use recursion.


o update SPARC chapter.  This will be chapter 0 pretty much.
o update title handling translate to html. 
o [Consistency] Shortest paths section uses special fonts for problem names.
