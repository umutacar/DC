** IMPORTANT: 
   Be careful when publishing. 
   It makes very destructive updates on the database.

   When publishing a chapter, check that the chapter number is correct.
   Otherwise, it might overwrite an existing chapter.



TODO: treatment of strings is ridiculous.  The same code, e.g.,
\cstr{x} yields different quotes based on the context.  See
sequences/ chapter for same examples.

Chapters

TODO: IMAGES.  Many need to be turned to jpg.
TODO: Upload design techniques
TODO: Upload sequences
TODO: consistency in code syntax.  treat function names as math variables and use mathit consistently. 

1 introduction/: Intro: done but check
  all = introduction.dex


2 preliminaries/
  preliminaries.dex

   code is intended by ~~ in math mode. should be ~~~  

3 language/: 
  language.dex

   code is intended by ~~ in math mode. should be ~~~  


5 models/:
  models.tex

   code is intended by ~~ in math mode. should be ~~~  

  TODO: The asymptotic notation with absolute values is very funky.
  It would probably be better to eliminate negative functions and
  handle them more consistently.  They don't seem consistent to me.

  TODO: We don't talk about worst-case, average case, expected case,
  etc forms of analysis.  This seems like a big omission.

5 sequences

  This used to be chapter 8.  It should be moved up front.

  It should also be rewritten.

  Sequences: This chapter is very heavy on notation.  
  There should be a much better way to do this.

  sequences.dex
 
  the following files are deprecated but kept temporarily. the
  sequences.dex file consists of these in that order.

  code is intended by ~~ in math mode. should be ~~~  

  semantics.dex
  comprehensions.dex
  cost.dex
  primes.dex


6 Algorithm Design Techniques
  design.dex
  This section was rewritten but would probably require more work.

   code is intended by ~~ in math mode. should be ~~~  

  TODO: This section could be rewritten.  TODO: this material depends
  on recurrences and sequences, it should move after them in
  thechapter order.

  A good example that worked well in class is to consider a sequence
  of integers and find the leftmost negative number in the sequence.
  You can use divide-and-conquer etc.


7 Recurrences
  recurrences.dex

   code is intended by ~~ in math mode. should be ~~~  

  TODO: Probably need a chapter on writing recurrences
  TODO: we can place a ref to a cross chapter atom here

8 Genome Sequencing
  genome.dex

   code is intended by ~~ in math mode. should be ~~~  


9 MCSS
  mcss.dex
   code is intended by ~~ in math mode. should be ~~~  

10 Probability Theory
   Not uploaded

11 Randomized Algorithms
   randomized.dex
   code is intended by ~~ in math mode. should be ~~~  

12 Binary Search TRees
   bsts.dex

   code is intended by ~~ in math mode. should be ~~~  

13 Sets and Dictionaries
   Not uploaded
   Art:

   We need to add list and array based cost semantics for these.


14 Graphs (Intro)
   code is intended by ~~ in math mode. should be ~~~  

15 Graph Search
   graph-searc/graph-search.dex
   code is intended by ~~ in math mode. should be ~~~  
 
16 Shortest Paths
   shortest-paths/shortest-paths
   code is intended by ~~~ in math mode.  

17 Graph Contraction
   graph-contraction/graph-contraction.dex

18 Minimum Spanning Trees
   mst/mst.dex

19 Hashing
   hashing/hashing.dex

   Took out parallel hashing and open addressing analysis. The
   analysis seems to be assuming no deletions (without stating it
   seemed) and were not well integrated.
