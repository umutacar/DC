\section{Problems}

\begin{probl}{}
There are 18 subgraphs for a triangle consisting of three vertices
and three edges connecting them, including the empty graph and the graph
itself.    List them all.
\end{probl}


\begin{probl}{}
In star contraction, what is the probability that a vertex with degree
$d$ is removed.
\end{probl}


\begin{probl}{}
Find an example graph, where star-based graph contraction removes a
small number of edges on each round.
\end{probl}

% Solution: a graph consisting of small stars that are connected with
% many edges. The star will be removed but all the cross edges between
% them will remain.  Must repeat this recursively to find the right
% structure.

\begin{probl}{}
Describe how to construct a graph that exhibits the worst-case
behavior for \thmref{gc::star-contraction-cost}.
\end{probl}

\begin{probl}{}
Is the star contraction algorithm work-optimal for a dense graph with
$\Omega(n^2)$ edges? Prove or disprove.
\end{probl}
