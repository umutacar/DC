\section{Problems}

\begin{probl}{Trees and edges}
Prove that any tree with $n$ vertices has $n-1$ edges. 
\end{probl}

\begin{probl}{MST with star contraction}
Work out the details of the algorithm for spanning trees using graph
contraction with star partitions (as mentioned in \secref{mst::mst})
and prove that it produces a spanning tree.
\end{probl}

\begin{probl}{Network design}
Prove that the network with the minimum cost in
\exref{mst::network-design} is indeed an MST of the graph.
\end{probl}

\begin{probl}{MST with priority queues}
Write out the pseudocode for a Priority Queue based implementation
of Prim's algorithm that runs in $O(m \log n)$ work.
\end{probl}



\begin{probl}{Unique MST's}
Prove that a graph with distinct edge weights has a unique minimum
spanning tree.
\end{probl}


\begin{probl}{Acyclic vertex-joiners}
  Prove that the vertex-joiners selected in any round \boruvka's
  algorithm form a forest.  Recall that we are assuming that no two
  edge weights are equal.
\end{probl}
%% Proof: Make unique, there exists a unique MST. joiners are part of
%% MST, which is acyclic by definition.
