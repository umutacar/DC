Several mutual exclusion examples.

** COMPILING
Use C++11

g++ -std=c++11  threads-allwrite.cpp

** FILES
The main files are

threads-allwrite.cpp 

this program creates a number of threads and runs them all.  it
demonstrates concurrency.  

we have to reason about multiple threads and what they do.  

the semantics is not sequential.  

execution is nondeterministic.
