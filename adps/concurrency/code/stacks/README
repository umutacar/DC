** FILES
The main files are
stack.h  (serial)
nb-stack.h (nonblocking)
nb-stack-aba.h (nonblocking, with aba problem)

There is some problem with compiling these on macos.  

You get an illegal instruction of some sort. The internet recommends 
using a special flag. I have not tried that out.
g++ -std=c++11 -mmacosx-version-min=10.5  stack-driver.cpp -o sd



** COMPILING

g++ -std=c++11  nb-stack-int.h
