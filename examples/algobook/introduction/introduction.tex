\begin{gram} 
This book aims to present techniques for problem solving using today's computers, including both sequentially and in parallel.
%
For example, you might want to find the shortest path from where you are now to the nearest caf\'e by using your computer.
%
The primary concerns will likely include correctness (the path found indeed should end at the nearest caf\'e), 
%
efficiency (that your computer consumed a relatively small amount of energy), and performance (the answer was computed reasonable quickly).
%

This book covers different aspects of problem solving with computers such as 
\begin{itemize}
\item defining precisely the problem you want to solve,
\item learning the different algorithm-design techniques for solving problems,
\item designing abstract data types and the data structures that
  implement them, and
%
\item analyzing and comparing the cost of algorithms and data structures.
%
\end{itemize}
\end{gram}

\begin{remark}
We are concerned both with 
%
parallel algorithms (algorithms that can perform multiple actions at the same time)
%
and 
%
sequential algorithms (algorithms that perform a single action at a time).
%
In our approach, however, sequential and parallel algorithms are not particularly different.
%
%In the rest of this chapter we discuss why it is important to study
%parallelism, why it is important to separate interfaces from
%implementations, and outline some algorithm-design techniques.
\end{remark}
