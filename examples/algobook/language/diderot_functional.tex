\begin{preamble}
\label{prmbl:language::functional-algorithms::describes}
This chapter describes the idea of functional algorithms as used in
this book along with some justification for the approach.

\label{grp:grm:language::functional-algorithms::aspects}

\begin{gram}
\label{grm:language::functional-algorithms::aspects}
There are two aspects of functional languages that are important for
our purposes.   The first is that program functions are ``pure'',
which is to say they act like mathematical functions and have no
effects beyond mapping an input to an output.    The second is that
functions can be treated as values, and as such can be passed as
arguments to other functions, returned as results, and stored in data
structures.  We describe each of these two aspects in turn.

\section{Pure Functions}
\label{sec:language::functional-algorithms::pure-functions}

\begin{cluster}
\label{grp:grm:language::functional-algorithms::function}

\begin{gram}
\label{grm:language::functional-algorithms::function}
A function in mathematics is mapping that associates each
possible input $x$ of a set $X$, the domain of the function, to a
single output $y$ of a set $Y$, the codomain of the function.
When a function is applied to an element $x \in X$, the associated
element $y$ is returned.     The application has no effect other than
returning $y$.

Functions in programming languages can act like mathematical functions.   For
example the C ``function'':
\begin{verbatim}
  int double(int x) { 
    return 2 * x;}
\end{verbatim}
acts like the mathematical function defined by the mapping \[\{(0,0), (-1, -2), (1,2), (2, 4),
  \ldots\}~.\]    However, in most programming languages, including C, it is also 
possible to modify state that is not part of the result.    This leads
to the notion of side effects, or simply effects.

\end{gram}
\end{cluster}

\begin{flex}
\label{grp:def:language::functional-algorithms::side-effects}

\begin{definition}[Side Effects]
\label{def:language::functional-algorithms::side-effects}
We say that a computation has a~\defn{side effect}, if in addition to
returning a value, it also performs an effect such as writing to an
existing memory location (possibly part of the input), printing on the screen, or writing to a
file.

\end{definition}

\begin{example}
\label{xmpl:language::functional-algorithms::function}
The C ``function''  
\begin{verbatim} 
int double(int x) { 
  y = 32; 
  return 2 * x;}
\end{verbatim}
returns twice the input $x$, as would a function, but also writes to
the location $y$.  It therefore has a side effect.

\end{example}
\end{flex}

\begin{cluster}
\label{grp:grm:language::functional-algorithms::process}

\begin{gram}
\label{grm:language::functional-algorithms::process}
The process of writing over a value in a location is often called \defn{mutation},
since it changes, or mutates, the value.

\end{gram}
\end{cluster}

\begin{flex}
\label{grp:def:language::functional-algorithms::pure-computation}

\begin{definition}[Pure Computation]
\label{def:language::functional-algorithms::pure-computation}
We say that a function in a program is ~\defn{pure} if it doesn't perform any side
  effects, and a computation is pure if all its functions are pure.
Pure computations return a value without performing any side effects.
In contrast an~\defn{impure} or~\defn{imperative} computation can
perform side effects.  

\end{definition}

\begin{example}
\label{xmpl:language::functional-algorithms::return}
The C function 
\begin{verbatim}
int fib(int i) {
   if (i <= 0) return i; 
   else return f(i-1) + f(i-2);}
\end{verbatim}
is pure since it does not have any side effects.    When applied it 
simply acts as the mathematical function defined by the mapping 
~\[\{(0,0),(1,1),(2,1),(3,2),(4,3),(5,5), \ldots\}~. \]

\end{example}
\end{flex}

\begin{cluster}
\label{grp:grm:language::functional-algorithms::pure}

\begin{gram}
\label{grm:language::functional-algorithms::pure}
In pure computation no data can ever be overwritten, only new data can 
be created.   Data is therefore always \defn{persistent}---if you keep a 
reference to a data structure, it will always be there and in the same 
state as it started. 

\end{gram}
\end{cluster}


\subsection{Safe for Parallelism}
\label{sec:language::functional-algorithms::safe-for-parallelism}

\begin{cluster}
\label{grp:grm:language::functional-algorithms::computation}

\begin{gram}
\label{grm:language::functional-algorithms::computation}
Pure computation is safe for parallelism.
In particular, when running different components of the computation in parallel they
cannot affect each other.  For any two function calls $f(a)$ and
$g(b)$, if we run $f(a)$ first, or $g(b)$ first, or interleave the
instructions of both, the two results will always be the same.  This
is because $f$ and $g$ are (pure) functions.  It means that when we
specify that two components of a program can run in parallel, the
run-time system is free to run them in either order on one processor, or
interleave their instructions in any way on two processors, without
worry.

In contrast, in imperative computation separate components, or
separate function calls, can effect each other under the hood.   
When running such components in parallel, they can then give different
results depending or the relative ordering of individual instructions
of
the two computations.     

\end{gram}
\end{cluster}

\begin{cluster}
\label{grp:def:language::functional-algorithms::race-conditions}

\begin{definition}[Race Conditions]
\label{def:language::functional-algorithms::race-conditions}
Side effects that alter the result of the computation based on the
evaluation order (timing) are called~\defn{race conditions}.

\end{definition}
\end{cluster}

\begin{cluster}
\label{grp:grm:language::functional-algorithms::race}

\begin{gram}
\label{grm:language::functional-algorithms::race}
Race conditions most often involve two components that are running
in parallel, one which is writing to a location, and the other is
either reading or writing the same location.     Since the exact timing on
real processors is highly unpredictable due to all sorts of features
in the processors (caches, pipelining, interruptions, sharing of
functional units, ...),   it is near impossible to guarantee how
instructions are interleaved between processors.     Furthermore it
can change every time the program is run.   Hence a program with race
conditions can return different results on different days.  Even
worse, it can return the same result for 20 years, before returning
something different, and perhaps catastrophic.

\end{gram}
\end{cluster}

\begin{cluster}
\label{grp:xmpl:language::functional-algorithms::spectacular}

\begin{example}
\label{xmpl:language::functional-algorithms::spectacular}
There are several spectacular examples of correctness problems caused
by race-conditions, including for example the Northeast blackout of
2003, which affected over 50 Million people in North America.

Here are some quotes from the spokesmen of the companies involved in
this event.

The first quote below describes the problem, which is a race
condition (multiple computations writing to the same piece of data).
"There was a couple of processes that were in contention for a common
data structure, and through a software coding error in one of the
application processes, they were both able to get write access to a
data structure at the same time [...] And that corruption led to the
alarm event application getting into an infinite loop and spinning."

The second  quote describes the difficulty of finding the bug.
"This fault was so deeply embedded, it took them [the team of
  engineers] weeks of poring through millions of lines of code and
data to find it."

\end{example}
\end{cluster}

\begin{cluster}
\label{grp:grm:language::functional-algorithms::approach}

\begin{gram}
\label{grm:language::functional-algorithms::approach}
One approach to reason about programs with race conditions is to
consider all possible interleavings of instructions on separate
processors.  In general, this can be very difficult since the number
of interleavings is exponential in the number of instructions.
However, there are structured techniques for programming with race
conditions.  This falls in the domain of ``concurrent programs''.
Data structures and algorithms that reason about race conditions are
typically called concurrent data structures and algorithms.

\end{gram}
\end{cluster}

\begin{cluster}
\label{grp:rmrk:language::functional-algorithms::heisenbug}

\begin{remark}[Heisenbug]
\label{rmrk:language::functional-algorithms::heisenbug}
Race conditions make it difficult to reason about the correctness and
the efficiency of parallel algorithms.  They also make debugging
difficult, because each time the code is run, it might give a
different answer.
For example, each time we evaluate a piece of code, we may obtain a
different answer or we may obtain a correct answer 99.99\% of the time
but not always.

The term~\defn{Heisenbug} was coined in the early 80s to refer to a
type of bug that ``disappears'' when you try to pinpoint or study it
and ``appears'' when you stop studying it.  They are named after the
famous Heisenberg uncertainty principle which roughly says that if you
localize one property, you will lose information about another
complementary property.  Often the most difficult Heisenbugs to find
have to do with race conditions in parallel or concurrent code.  These
are sometimes also called concurrency bugs.

\end{remark}
\end{cluster}

\begin{cluster}
\label{grp:grm:language::functional-algorithms::conditions}

\begin{gram}
\label{grm:language::functional-algorithms::conditions}
Race conditions cannot occur in pure computation, but not all
impure programs have race conditions.  For example, an imperative
program with no parallelism has no race conditions.

\end{gram}
\end{cluster}


\subsection{Persistence}
\label{sec:language::functional-algorithms::persistence}

\begin{cluster}
\label{grp:grm:language::functional-algorithms::benefit}

\begin{gram}
\label{grm:language::functional-algorithms::benefit}
Another important benefit of pure functions is that all data is
``persistent''.   Since a function does not modify its input, it means
that for pure functions, the input remains the same after applying the
function.   In other words, the input persists.     This can be very
useful in some applications.

\end{gram}
\end{cluster}

\begin{cluster}
\label{grp:rmrk:language::functional-algorithms::astute}

\begin{remark}
\label{rmrk:language::functional-algorithms::astute}
  The astute reader might ask the question: if the inputs persist then won't that
  be a waste of memory?  Indeed if a programmer keeps the input for later use, this
  could be a waste of memory.  However, many languages
  have what is called a garbage collector, which will collect any data
  that is no longer needed.  Therefore, if a function makes a call to
  $f(x)$, but no longer needs $x$, then $x$
  can be collected and its memory reclaimed.   In fact, a smart
  compiler might recognize that
  $x$ is no longer needed and not referenced by anyone else and allow it to be updated ``in place''
  overwriting the old value.    We will make use of this optimization
  in a later chapter that optimizes a pure implementation of sequences (Chapter~\ref{ch:sequences::ephemeral}).

\end{remark}
\end{cluster}


\subsection{Benign Effects}
\label{sec:language::functional-algorithms::benign-effects}

\begin{flex}
\label{grp:grm:language::functional-algorithms::benign-effects}

\begin{gram}[Benign Effects]
\label{grm:language::functional-algorithms::benign-effects}
The notion of purity can be further extended to allow for effects
that are not~\defn{observable}.  
For example, the Fibonacci function
described above may be implemented by using a mutable reference that
holds some intermediate value that may be used to compute
the result.
If this reference is not observable (e.g., not visible to the caller
of the function or any other functions), the function has no observable
effect, and can thus be considered pure.  Such effects are sometimes
called~\defn{benign effects}.
This more general notion of purity is important because it allows for
example using side effects in a ``responsible'' fashion to improve
efficiency.

\end{gram}

\begin{example}
\label{xmpl:language::functional-algorithms::factorial}
The C function 
\begin{verbatim}
int factorial(int i) {
   int r = 1;
   for (int j = 1; j <= i; j++) r = r * i;
   return r;}
\end{verbatim}
is not pure since it side effects (mutates) the value of \texttt{r}, but the
side effect is not visible outside of the function.   It is therefore
a benign effect from the point of view of anyone calling factorial.

\end{example}
\end{flex}

\begin{cluster}
\label{grp:imp:language::functional-algorithms::strictly}

\begin{important}
\label{imp:language::functional-algorithms::strictly}
Strictly speaking there is probably no non-trivial computation that is
pure all the way to the ``metal'' (hardware) because almost any computation performs memory effects at the
hardware level.  Encapsulation of effects by observation is therefore
essential for meaningful discussions of purity.

\end{important}
\end{cluster}


\section{Functions as Values}
\label{sec:language::functional-algorithms::functions-as-values}

\begin{flex}
\label{grp:grm:language::functional-algorithms::almost}

\begin{gram}
\label{grm:language::functional-algorithms::almost}
Almost all programming languages allow applying a function to a
value.  Not all, however, allow passing functions as arguments, returning
them from other functions, storing them in data structures and
generating new functions.
This ability to use functions in this way is sometimes referred to as
``functions as first-class values''---i.e., functions can be treated
as values.

\end{gram}

\begin{example}[Examples of Functions as Values]
\label{xmpl:language::functional-algorithms::examples-of-functions-as-values}
In the following definition (using \pml{})
\[
\begin{array}{l}
f(x) =
\\
~~~~\cd{let}~g(y) = x + y 
\\
~~~~\cd{in}~g~\cd{end}
\\
\\
z = f(3)
\end{array}
\]
the variable $z$ is bound to a function that adds three to its argument, i.e., the function $\{(0,3),(1,4),\ldots\}$.   We
can apply $z(7)$ and it would return $10$.   We can also create
another function $f(5)$ that adds $5$ to its argument.
And we can pass $z$, or any other function, as an argument.   For
example consider the definition
\[
\begin{array}{l}
g(y) = y(6) 
\end{array}
\]
Now $g(z)$ returns $9$ since in the body of $f$ we apply the
function $z$, which adds $3$, to $6$.   And $g(f(5))$ returns $11$.
Finally we can store functions in data structures, as in 
\[
\begin{array}{l}
\cseq{f(3), f(1), f(6)}
\end{array}
\]
which is a sequence containing three functions, one that adds $3$ one
that adds $1$ and one that adds $6$.

\end{example}
\end{flex}

\begin{cluster}
\label{grp:grm:language::functional-algorithms::treating}

\begin{gram}
\label{grm:language::functional-algorithms::treating}
Treating functions as values leads to a powerful way to code.  
Functions that take other functions as arguments are often
called~\defn{higher-order functions}.
Higher-order functions (even in a language that is not pure)
help with the design and implementation of parallel algorithm by
encouraging the designer to think at a higher level of abstraction.

For example, instead of thinking about a loop that iterates over the
elements of an array to generate the sum, which is completely
sequential, we can define a higher-order ``reduce'' function. 
In addition to taking the array as an argument, the reduce function
takes a binary associative function as another argument.  It then sums
the array based on that binary associative function.
The advantage is that the higher-order reduce allows for any
binary associative function (e.g. maximum, minimum, multiplication).
By implementing the reduce function as a tree sum, which is highly
parallel, we can thus perform a variety of computations in parallel
rather than sequentially as a loop.
In general, thinking in higher order functions encourages working at a
higher level of abstraction, moving us away from the one-at-a-time
(loop) way of thinking that is detrimental to code quality and
to parallelism.

\section{Functional Algorithms}
\label{sec:language::functional-algorithms::functional-algorithms}

\begin{cluster}
\label{grp:grm:language::functional-algorithms::book}

\begin{gram}
\label{grm:language::functional-algorithms::book}
In this book we use algorithms that use pure functions and support functions as
first-class values.
We refer to these as~\defn{functional algorithms}.

\end{gram}
\end{cluster}

\begin{cluster}
\label{grp:rmrk:language::functional-algorithms::coding}

\begin{remark}
\label{rmrk:language::functional-algorithms::coding}
Coding a functional algorithm does not require a purely
functional programming language.
In fact, a functional algorithm can be coded in essentially any
programming language---one just needs to be very careful when
coding imperatively in order to avoid errors caused by sharing of
state and side effects.  
Some imperative parallel languages such as extension to the C
language, in fact, encourage programming functional algorithms.
The techniques that we describe thus are applicable to  imperative
programming languages as  well.

\end{remark}
